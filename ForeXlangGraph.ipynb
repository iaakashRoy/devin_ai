CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today previewed macOS Sequoia, the next version of the world’s most advanced desktop operating system, bringing entirely new ways of working and transformative intelligence features to Mac. macOS Sequoia is full of exciting new capabilities, including iPhone Mirroring, which expands Continuity by enabling full access to and control of iPhone directly from macOS. Safari gets another big update with the new Highlights feature for effortless information discovery on webpages while browsing. The new Passwords app makes it even easier to access passwords and organize credentials all in one place. Gaming advances with a more immersive experience, as well as a breadth of new titles, including Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Frostpunk 2, and more.macOS Sequoia also introduces Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system for Mac, iPhone, and iPad that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that’s incredibly useful and relevant. Built with privacy from the ground up, Apple Intelligence is deeply integrated into macOS Sequoia, iOS 18, and iPadOS 18. It understands and creates language and images, takes action across apps, and draws from personal context, simplifying and accelerating everyday tasks. Taking full advantage of the power of Apple silicon and the Neural Engine, Apple Intelligence will be supported by every Mac with an M-series chip.1“The all-star combination of the power of Apple silicon and the legendary ease of use of macOS have made the Mac more capable than ever. Today, we’re excited to take macOS to new heights with macOS Sequoia, a big release that elevates productivity and intelligence,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “macOS Sequoia ushers in Apple Intelligence, unlocking incredible new features that will be a game changer for working on Mac. And with more ways to help users effortlessly get things done, new Continuity features like iPhone Mirroring, major updates to Safari, and a host of new games, we think Mac users are going to love it.”Wirelessly Use iPhone Right from Mac with iPhone MirroringmacOS Sequoia makes Continuity even more magical with iPhone Mirroring, which allows users to fully access and engage with their iPhone — right from their Mac. A user’s custom wallpaper and icons appear just like on their iPhone, and they can swipe between pages on their Home Screen, or launch and browse any of their favorite apps. The keyboard, trackpad, and mouse on Mac also let a user interact with their iPhone, and audio even comes through. Users can seamlessly drag and drop between iPhone and Mac, and a user’s iPhone remains locked, so nobody else can access or see what the user is doing. It also works great with StandBy, which stays visible, so users can get information at a glance. Additionally, users can review and respond to iPhone notifications directly from their Mac.With iPhone Mirroring, a user wirelessly uses their iPhone 15 Pro from the desktop of their MacBook Pro.A user drags and drops content between their iPhone 15 Pro and their MacBook Pro.Notifications from a user’s iPhone show up in the corner of their MacBook Pro.macOS Sequoia makes Continuity even more magical with iPhone Mirroring, which lets users wirelessly use their iPhone right from their Mac.With iPhone Mirroring, users can seamlessly drag and drop files, photos, videos, and more between iPhone and Mac.

Ubisoft will release Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown and Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and Capcom will offer even more exciting titles from the popular RESIDENT EVIL series, including RESIDENT EVIL 7 biohazard and RESIDENT EVIL 2. The next major expansion of World of Warcraft: The War Within is coming later this year. Also on the way are Frostpunk 2, Palworld, Sniper Elite 4, and RoboCop: Rogue City, all leveraging powerful software technologies like MetalFX Upscaling to accelerate performance and deliver high-quality visuals across the Mac lineup. And Control Ultimate Edition and Wuthering Waves are coming soon, taking advantage of the latest M3 family of chips to deliver breathtaking visuals with ray tracing.A more immersive gaming experience: Personalized Spatial Audio puts players in the middle of the action like never before, while significantly reduced audio latency with AirPods Pro (2nd generation) provides even better responsiveness. Improvements to Game Mode unlock smoother frame rates, and advanced power management features boost performance across the Mac lineup.Game Porting Toolkit 2: Since the introduction of the Game Porting Toolkit, developers have been able to bring their games to Apple devices faster than ever, and gaming enthusiasts can experience more titles on the Mac. Game Porting Toolkit 2 takes this to the next level with some of the most-requested capabilities from game developers, making it even easier to bring advanced games to Mac, as well as iPhone and iPad.Ubisoft will release the highly anticipated Assassin’s Creed Shadows (above), the next installment in the blockbuster series — along with Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown on Mac.Window Tiling Is Easier and Faster Than EverUsers can stay organized with new ways to arrange windows into a layout that works best for them. When a user drags a window to the edge of the screen, macOS Sequoia automatically\\xa0suggests a tiled position on their desktop. Users can release their window right into place, quickly arrange tiles side by side, or place them in corners to keep even more apps in view. And new keyboard and menu shortcuts help users organize tiles even faster.Easier window tiling lets users quickly drag windows into key areas on their screen to effortlessly arrange them into side-by-side tiles, or place them into corners to keep even more apps in view.Video Conferencing Gets More UpdatesThe new presenter preview makes it easier to present, letting users see what they’re about to share before they share it, and works with apps like FaceTime and Zoom. Users can also apply beautiful built-in backgrounds, including a variety of color gradients and system wallpapers, or upload their own photos. Background replacements can be applied during a video call in FaceTime or in third-party apps like Webex, and with Apple’s industry-leading segmentation, users will look their best when on a call.The new presenter preview is shown on a user’s Mac desktop.On a user’s MacBook Pro, a menu of background replacements are shown in FaceTime.Presenter preview lets users see exactly what they’re going to share in video call apps — whether it’s a single app or their whole screen — before displaying it for everyone.Users can select beautiful built-in backgrounds, while Apple’s industry-leading segmentation technology helps them look their best.previousnextThe New Passwords App Keeps Credentials Secure and OrganizedBuilt on the foundation of Keychain, which was first introduced over 25 years ago, macOS Sequoia brings Passwords, a new app that makes it even easier to access passwords, passkeys, Wi-Fi passwords, and other credentials all in one place. iCloud syncing is backed by secure end-to-end encryption. Passwords works great with Safari, and seamlessly syncs between a user’s Apple devices and Windows with the iCloud for Windows app.                A new Passwords app makes it even easier to access passwords and organize credentials all in one place.              Apple Intelligence Ushers in the Next Chapter of AI on MacDeeply integrated into macOS Sequoia and built with privacy from the ground up, Apple Intelligence unlocks new ways for users to enhance their writing and communicate more effectively. With brand-new systemwide Writing Tools built into macOS Sequoia, users can rewrite, proofread, and summarize text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps.The Apple Intelligence-powered Rewrite tool is shown on a user’s MacBook Pro.The Apple Intelligence-powered Proofread tool is shown on a user’s MacBook Pro.The Apple Intelligence-powered Summarize tool is shown on a user’s MacBook Pro.Apple Intelligence powers Writing Tools like Rewrite, which allows users to choose from different versions of what they have written, adjusting the tone to suit the audience and task at hand.Proofread checks grammar, word choice, and sentence structure while also suggesting edits — along with explanations of the edits — that users can review or quickly accept.With Summarize, users can select text and have it recapped in the form of a digestible paragraph, bulleted key points, a table, or a list.previousnextNew image capabilities make communication and self-expression even more fun. With Image Playground, users can create playful images in seconds, choosing from three styles: Animation, Illustration, or Sketch. Image Playground is easy to use, built right into apps like Messages, and also available in a dedicated app.                With Image Playground, users can choose from a range of concepts from categories, type a description to define an image, choose someone from their personal photo library to include in their image, and pick their favorite style.              Memories in Photos lets users create the stories they want to see just by typing a description.

Safari gets another big update with the new Highlights feature for effortless information discovery on webpages while browsing. The new Passwords app makes it even easier to access passwords and organize credentials all in one place. Gaming advances with a more immersive experience, as well as a breadth of new titles, including Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Frostpunk 2, and more.macOS Sequoia also introduces Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system for Mac, iPhone, and iPad that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that’s incredibly useful and relevant. Built with privacy from the ground up, Apple Intelligence is deeply integrated into macOS Sequoia, iOS 18, and iPadOS 18. It understands and creates language and images, takes action across apps, and draws from personal context, simplifying and accelerating everyday tasks. Taking full advantage of the power of Apple silicon and the Neural Engine, Apple Intelligence will be supported by every Mac with an M-series chip.1“The all-star combination of the power of Apple silicon and the legendary ease of use of macOS have made the Mac more capable than ever. Today, we’re excited to take macOS to new heights with macOS Sequoia, a big release that elevates productivity and intelligence,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “macOS Sequoia ushers in Apple Intelligence, unlocking incredible new features that will be a game changer for working on Mac. And with more ways to help users effortlessly get things done, new Continuity features like iPhone Mirroring, major updates to Safari, and a host of new games, we think Mac users are going to love it.”Wirelessly Use iPhone Right from Mac with iPhone MirroringmacOS Sequoia makes Continuity even more magical with iPhone Mirroring, which allows users to fully access and engage with their iPhone — right from their Mac. A user’s custom wallpaper and icons appear just like on their iPhone, and they can swipe between pages on their Home Screen, or launch and browse any of their favorite apps. The keyboard, trackpad, and mouse on Mac also let a user interact with their iPhone, and audio even comes through. Users can seamlessly drag and drop between iPhone and Mac, and a user’s iPhone remains locked, so nobody else can access or see what the user is doing. It also works great with StandBy, which stays visible, so users can get information at a glance. Additionally, users can review and respond to iPhone notifications directly from their Mac.Big Updates Come to SafariSafari, the world’s fastest\\xa0browser,2 now offers Highlights, an even easier way to discover information on the web, such as directions, summaries, or quick links to learn more about people, music, movies, and TV shows. A redesigned Reader includes even more ways to enjoy articles without distractions, featuring a streamlined view of the article a user is reading, a summary, and a table of contents for longer articles. And when Safari detects a video on the page, Viewer helps users put it front and center, while still giving them full access to system playback\\xa0controls, including\\xa0Picture in Picture.Gaming Gets Even Better with Highly Anticipated Titles and MoreA stellar lineup of games is coming\\xa0to Mac\\xa0— including the highly anticipated Assassin’s Creed Shadows, the next installment in Ubisoft’s blockbuster series — alongside new features like Personalized Spatial Audio that make gaming even more immersive.Highly anticipated titles: Developers are delivering an amazing host of new titles to Mac. Ubisoft will release Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown and Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and Capcom will offer even more exciting titles from the popular RESIDENT EVIL series, including RESIDENT EVIL 7 biohazard and RESIDENT EVIL 2. The next major expansion of World of Warcraft: The War Within is coming later this year. Also on the way are Frostpunk 2, Palworld, Sniper Elite 4, and RoboCop: Rogue City, all leveraging powerful software technologies like MetalFX Upscaling to accelerate performance and deliver high-quality visuals across the Mac lineup. And Control Ultimate Edition and Wuthering Waves are coming soon, taking advantage of the latest M3 family of chips to deliver breathtaking visuals with ray tracing.A more immersive gaming experience: Personalized Spatial Audio puts players in the middle of the action like never before, while significantly reduced audio latency with AirPods Pro (2nd generation) provides even better responsiveness. Improvements to Game Mode unlock smoother frame rates, and advanced power management features boost performance across the Mac lineup.Game Porting Toolkit 2: Since the introduction of the Game Porting Toolkit, developers have been able to bring their games to Apple devices faster than ever, and gaming enthusiasts can experience more titles on the Mac. Game Porting Toolkit 2 takes this to the next level with some of the most-requested capabilities from game developers, making it even easier to bring advanced games to Mac, as well as iPhone and iPad.Window Tiling Is Easier and Faster Than EverUsers can stay organized with new ways to arrange windows into a layout that works best for them. When a user drags a window to the edge of the screen, macOS Sequoia automatically\\xa0suggests a tiled position on their desktop. Users can release their window right into place, quickly arrange tiles side by side, or place them in corners to keep even more apps in view. And new keyboard and menu shortcuts help users organize tiles even faster.Video Conferencing Gets More UpdatesThe new presenter preview makes it easier to present, letting users see what they’re about to share before they share it, and works with apps like FaceTime and Zoom. Users can also apply beautiful built-in backgrounds, including a variety of color gradients and system wallpapers, or upload their own photos. Background replacements can be applied during a video call in FaceTime or in third-party apps like Webex, and with Apple’s industry-leading segmentation, users will look their best when on a call.The New Passwords App Keeps Credentials Secure and OrganizedBuilt on the foundation of Keychain, which was first introduced over 25 years ago, macOS Sequoia brings Passwords, a new app that makes it even easier to access passwords, passkeys, Wi-Fi passwords, and other credentials all in one place. iCloud syncing is backed by secure end-to-end encryption. Passwords works great with Safari, and seamlessly syncs between a user’s Apple devices and Windows with the iCloud for Windows app.Apple Intelligence Ushers in the Next Chapter of AI on MacDeeply integrated into macOS Sequoia and built with privacy from the ground up, Apple Intelligence unlocks new ways for users to enhance their writing and communicate more effectively. With brand-new systemwide Writing Tools built into macOS Sequoia, users can rewrite, proofread, and summarize text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps.New image capabilities make communication and self-expression even more fun. With Image Playground, users can create playful images in seconds, choosing from three styles: Animation, Illustration, or Sketch. Image Playground is easy to use, built right into apps like Messages, and also available in a dedicated app.Memories in Photos lets users create the stories they want to see just by typing a description. Apple Intelligence will pick out the best photos and videos based on the description, craft a storyline with chapters based on themes identified from the photos, and arrange them into a movie with its own narrative arc. In addition, a new Clean Up tool can identify and remove distracting objects in the background of a photo — without accidentally altering the subject.With the power of Apple Intelligence, Siri takes a major step forward, becoming even more natural, contextually relevant, and personal.

Even though the iPhone 16 series launch is still over two months away, when you consider that we learned about larger displays on the iPhone 16 Pro models way back in May 2023, rumors about a two-generations-away iPhone isn\\'t all that unusual so far ahead of time. While we await this year\\'s iPhone 16 series, here\\'s a compilation of everything we have heard from reputable sources so far about Apple\\'s so-called iPhone 17 \"Slim.\" iPhone 17 Slim: Rumors So FarThinner DesignAccording to The Information, Apple\\'s all-new iPhone 17 model next year will have a \"significantly thinner\" design with an aluminum chassis, rather than a titanium casing like Apple\\'s Pro models. The news outlet also claims that the device will feature a narrower Dynamic Island, potentially due to Apple\\'s adoption of a smaller \"metalens\" for the Face ID system. Internally code-named D23, the device\\'s redesign has been described as a major one equivalent to the iPhone X.Smaller DisplayThe first details about the size of the device\\'s display arrived courtesy of Haitong International Securities analyst Jeff Pu, who said it would be 6.6 inches. However, according to Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC) analyst Ross Young, it will feature a 6.55-inch display. For comparison, the iPhone 15 Plus has a 6.7-inch display. Apple is still said to be testing different designs for the slimmer phone, so the display size could always change between now and the device\\'s launch.Relocated CamerasThe Information claimed that the iPhone 17 \"Slim\" will have cameras in locations we haven\\'t seen before on an iPhone. According to a May report, the rear cameras could be moved to the \"top center\" of the device. Some Android phones like Google\\'s Pixel 8 Pro have rear cameras in a top-center position, but Apple\\'s iPhone camera system has occupied the top-left corner ever since the 2007 model. Anti-Reflective CoatingAll iPhone 17 models will feature an anti-reflective display that is more scratch-resistant than Apple\\'s Ceramic Shield found on iPhone 15 models, according to Chinese Weibo leaker Instant Digital. The outer glass on the iPhone 17 series is said to have a \"super-hard anti-reflective layer\" that is \"more scratch-resistant.\" It\\'s not clear whether Apple is planning to adopt the Gorilla Glass Armor that Samsung uses in its Galaxy S24 Ultra, but the description of Corning\\'s latest technology matches the rumor.ProMotion TechnologyAccording to The Elec, all iPhone 17 models will feature OLED displays with low-power backplane technology, bringing ProMotion to Apple\\'s non-Pro iPhone models for the first time. ProMotion allows the display to ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video content when required. ProMotion also allows the display to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate as low as 1Hz, which is why the iPhone 15 Pro screens feature an always-on capability that shows the Lock Screen\\'s clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even when the device is locked.Improved Selfie CameraAccording to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the entire iPhone 17 lineup will feature a 24-megapixel front-facing camera with a six-element lens. The iPhone 14 and 15 feature a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with five plastic lens elements, and this year\\'s iPhone 16 lineup is expected to feature the same hardware. The upgraded resolution on the iPhone 17 will allow photos to maintain their quality even when cropped or zoomed in, while the larger number of pixels will capture finer details. The upgrade to a six-element lens should also slightly enhance image quality.Internal UpgradesHaitong analyst Jeff Pu claims the iPhone 17 \"Slim\" will feature 8GB of RAM, compared to 6GB of RAM on the iPhone 15 Plus. It\\'s worth noting that all upcoming iPhone 16 models are expected to be fitted with 8GB of RAM – a hardware requirement of on-device Apple Intelligence. According to The Information, the device will also be equipped with Apple\\'s A19 chip.Higher PriceThe Information reported that the slimmer iPhone 17 could have a higher price tag than the Pro Max model, which currently starts at $1,199, suggesting that the device would become the ew highest-end model in the lineup, bettering the iPhone 17 Pro Max. If that\\'s the case, then perhaps the \"iPhone Slim\" will end up being the \"iPhone Ultra\" that has been rumored for several years.Related Roundup: iPhone 17[ 187 comments ]Get weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.Popular StoriesiPhone 17 \\'Slim\\': Everything We Know So FarFriday July 5, 2024 5:13 am PDT by Tim HardwickIn 2025, Apple is expected to discontinue the iPhone \"Plus\" device in its iPhone 17 lineup to make way for an iPhone \"Slim\" – although it may not actually be called this when it debuts in the fall of next year.

There are two Mac mini chips available in the current line —  the M2 and the M2 Pro. Each model has pros and cons and it will depend solely on the customer's needs when choosing the right one. Subscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeSubscribe to AppleInsider on YouTube Mac mini with Apple's M2 chip The latest iteration of the Mac mini was released in 2023. Equipped with either an M2 or M2 Pro chip, the compact desktop starts at $599, $100 cheaper than the MSRP of the M1 Mac mini. The M2 Mac mini is the best balance of computing power to cost for the computer-as-appliance crowd that you can get for the money. There are two Thunderbolt 4 ports in M1 or M2 models and four in M2 Pro models. There are also two USB-A ports for further peripheral support and a headphone jack for wired audio. Mac mini with the M1 processor The last-gen M1 processor is a custom chipset developed by Apple for use in desktop and laptop computers. It is the result of years of development surrounding the A-series processors used in iPhones and Apple's desire to control the entire technology stack in the Mac. Unlike the M2 Mac mini, which comes in M2 and M2 Pro variants, there was only one Apple Silicon option available in the M1 Mac mini line. Shoppers could configure the amount of internal storage and RAM at purchase, however, choosing from 256GB to 2TB of internal storage and 8GB or 16GB of memory. Mac mini FAQ What is the cheapest Mac mini? Retail M2 Mac mini prices start at $599, but discounts offer up to $250 off the latest models. Should I buy Mac mini? Apple's Mac mini is the most affordable entry point into the Mac line, with the ability to connect a monitor of your choosing. With the ability to opt for an M2 or M2 Pro chip, the 2023 Mac mini is a viable option for business professionals, students, and home users alike. When considering whether you should buy a Mac mini, remember the memory cannot be upgraded, so if you regularly use 8GB or more, it's best to opt for a configuration with 16GB or 32GB RAM.
